# README

YouBeHero is a charity platform which aims to help non-profit organizations with financial assistance.

A user selects an eshop from the list (either to book a ticket, to buy clothes, shoes or books), then selects the cause to which he wants the commision given from his purchase to be attributed to and YouBeHero redirects him there while remembering and donating his attribution to the cause of his / her preference.
